Propositional logic: This week we will explore the basics of propositional logic in order to help develop some framework to practice True\/False questions when studying for the exam.  The assignment for this week is to complete , , and and upload your work to Gradescope. The additional (non-question) text is just to help you understand the assignment.   A mathematical statement (also called a proposition ) is a sentence which is either true or false.   Each of the following is a mathematical statement. Depending on the matrices or vectors involved, each may be true or false.   (1)   is consistent.  (2)   is row equivalent to .  (3)   has a non‑trivial solution.  (4)   The columns of are linearly dependent.  (5)   is onto.   For example, (1) is true if and , but false if and .    Pick one of the statements (2)–(5) above. Give:   a choice of vectors\/matrices that makes the statement true,  a choice that makes the same statement false.   Verify your answers using appropriate calculations.   Note: Please write the problem statement you are solving to help the grader.        Combining Statements  Statements can be combined using logical connectives such as and , or , and implies .   (6)   is row equivalent to  and  is consistent.  (7)   has a non‑trivial solution or  is onto.  (8a)   The columns of are linearly dependent implies  has a non‑trivial solution.  (8a)   If the columns of are linearly dependent, then  has a non‑trivial solution.   Implications are commonly written using if–then language. The statements (8a) and (8b) express the same idea using different wording.  An implication is true when the truth of the “if” part forces the “then” part to be true.  For example, if the columns of are linearly dependent, then there is a free variable in , yielding a non‑trivial solution. Thus, (8a) and (8b) are true.  An implication is false if there exists a counterexample where the “if” part is true but the “then” part is false.   (9)   If and , then .   This implication is false. For example, let and . Then and both satisfy , but .    Choose one true and one false implication from any practice exam.   Identify the “if” and “then” propositions.  If false, give a counterexample with explanation.  If true, give a short general explanation using correct terminology.    Note: Write the full problem statement to assist the grader.       Quantifiers  Some statements involve quantifiers . The two most common are:   for all (universal quantifier),  for some (existential quantifier).   Notice the quantifiers in the follow statements.   (10)   If is consistent for some  , then has a pivot in every row.  (11)   If does not have a pivot in every column and , then for every  we have .   Question Q3    For statements (10) and (11):   Identify the propositions.  Both statements are false. Provide a counterexample for one of them and explain why the counterexample works.    Hint: For (10), choose and such that is consistent but lacks a pivot in every row.   Hint: For (11), choose without a pivot in every column and vectors such that .      "

Consider the following problems from previous Exam 1 midterms.    1(a)viii T\/F (Fall ’25):  If and , then .    1(a)vi T\/F (Spring ’25):  If and are both solutions to an inhomogeneous system , then is also a solution to .    1(a)v T\/F (Spring ’23):  If is size and none of the rows of consist entirely of zeros, then has 3 pivots.    1(a)v T\/F (Fall ’23):  If is a linearly independent set, then .    1(a)i T\/F – modified (Spring ’25):  If the system is inconsistent, then there is not a pivot in the last row of the REF of the coefficient matrix .    1(a)ii T\/F (Spring ’24):  If the linear transformation is one‑to‑one, then has a unique solution.      For each of the true\/false problems above, complete tasks (i)–(ii) below.   Write the problem and provide the answer.    Do one example that illustrates whether the statement could be true or must be false. The example may be:   an example showing the statement can be satisfied, or  a counterexample showing the statement must be false.   For instance, for problem (1) you would choose a matrix and vectors so that and both satisfy , then check whether also satisfies the equation.  Say explicitly whether your example is a counterexample or not. Note: Your example does not need to be a counterexample even if the original statement is false—any example is acceptable.          Create New Problems    Create two new problems (7) and (8). Each new problem should be a modification of one of the six original problems. For example, you may:   change the premise or conclusion of an implication,  switch “onto” with “one‑to‑one”,  change “linearly independent” to “linearly dependent”,  swap the order of the implication, or negate the if‑part or then‑part.   After writing each new problem, repeat tasks (i)–(ii). Clearly state which original problem you modified.      "
